CheckboxRenderer
================
Renderer type class for `checkbox` type data values.
Renders an `<input type="checkbox">` element as an editor and has no display.

See [BaseRenderer](BaseRenderer.md) for more details.

Notes
-----
  - This renderer doesn't use a display - only a checkbox editor, as it provides
    a better user experience with only a single click to edit.
